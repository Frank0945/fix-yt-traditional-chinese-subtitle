# fix-yt-traditional-chinese-subtitle

Corrected the issue that prevented the proper display of YouTube's automatic translation in Traditional Chinese.

The options in the subtitle menu will be modified when your YouTube language is set to Chinese (Traditional), with the addition of "[Fix] Chinese (Traditional)" and the hiding of Chinese (Simplified). If your YouTube language is not set to Chinese (Traditional), selecting Simplified Chinese subtitles will automatically be translated into Traditional Chinese.
